#### Bonus
- Rewrite the application using a JavaScript MVC library. Include a readme that explains the benefits and any additional challenges students would face learning the library


### Benfits
- Using Angular allows you to not have to worry about DOM manipulations (unless you want to do some really fancy stuff)
- It requires significantly less code and allows you to worry about just manipulating data
	- Proper separation of MVC
		- Your code is the Model, which is simply handling the data
		- HTML is your View, it is static and you don't update this as Angular does the updating for you
		- Angular is the Controller that handles updating the View based on data changes in the Model


### Challenges
- Learning the ins and outs of "Angular Thinking" about how to structure your website/web application
	- Once you get the hang of it, Angular really is way way easier
